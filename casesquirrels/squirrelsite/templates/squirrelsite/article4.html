<h2>New Courses for Summer 2021!</h2>
<p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2">Hear ye, hear ye! Attention students!</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2">New classes for the Summer 2021 term are being announced as the university community makes its way through Spring 2021, and there are a couple of classes that have caught our eye here as Case Western student writers. Below we&rsquo;ve listed a handful of courses that we will definitely be considering in order to get ahead in our gen ed requirements. In no particular order, here our our staff&rsquo;s top picks for Summer 2021 courses:</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">ENGL 245: What Is A Word? Shakespeare, Webster, and the English Language. </span><span class="c2">This class focuses on the origin of the modern English language, and how it has evolved with the use of technologies such as the printing press, theater, social media, and more. Maybe you&rsquo;ll create a new word in this class!</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">BIOC 327: Biochemistry of Emotion.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Have you ever asked yourself, why in the hell do I feel the way I do? Well look no further, as this course gives you an in-depth analysis of the biological determinants of emotion and thought! This class is particularly recommended for cognitive science students, premeds, and anyone interested in the connections between biology and thought. Cross-listed as PSCL 327 and <a href="{% url 'squirrels:sqrl_layer'%}" style="text-decoration: none; color: #212529;">SQRL</a> 427.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c5">DANC 226: Interpretive Dance for the Biomedical Engineer.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;BME premeds, this is the course for you! Your rigorous course load surely doesn&rsquo;t allow you to work out as much as you&rsquo;d like, so here is a university-mandated, mandatory physical education class. Don&rsquo;t forget to bring your tap shoes and your leotards. Cross-listed as PHED 226.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, feel free to reach out to our editorial staff if you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding our course choices.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p>
