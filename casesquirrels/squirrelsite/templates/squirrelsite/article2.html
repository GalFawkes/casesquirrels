An Interview With S. L. Barnens

<h2>An Exclusive Interview with S. L. Barnens</h2>
<p class="c1"><span class="c4">Attached is a never-before seen interview between a staff writer for The Daily, Erica Seasons, and local environmental conservationist, S. L. Barnens. The interview was never used in previous issues due to a lack of interest in content about the environment.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">SEASONS: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Barnens. Would you care to tell us a little about your work in and around Cleveland?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">BARNENS: Certainly. I&rsquo;m an environmental conservationist hired by Case Western to help ensure that they&rsquo;re following local government regulations regarding land usage. University Circle is a relatively urban area so the amount of greenspace is small, but whatever is available is always being used by smaller animals like rabbits and squirrels. It&rsquo;s important to maintain these habitats and promote the local biodiversity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">SEASONS: Thank you. Now, you have also done some independent research regarding urban animal habitats. What was your focus and what was the end goal of these projects?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">BARNENS: Sure. My most recently published work focuses on the effects of sound pollution on the population density of rabbits in University Circle and the local college campuses. My findings showed that, most of the time, rabbits have become habituated to the sounds and machines of the modern world and aren&rsquo;t particularly phased by them. As you get farther away from the commotion, they tend to spread out more and remain farther from noisy areas like roads. These results might help contractors in building future roads and buildings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">SEASONS: And is this the focus of your previous research as well?<br>BARNENS: No, not quite. I had a previous project that studied the interactions between species living within University Circle, which included birds, squirrels, and rabbits commonly found around campus buildings. An even older project called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" style="color:#000; text-decoration: none;">Topography Analysis of Integrated Locales</a>&rdquo; (which I like to call the <a href="{% url 'squirrels:tree_layer'%}" style="text-decoration: none; color: #000;">TAIL</a>s research) looked at the differing topographical areas around the greater Cleveland area to determine the likelihood of certain species being found in and around University Circle, and therefore what policies should be put in place to protect those animals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">SEASONS: This is all extremely interesting, Dr. Barnens. Rumor has it that you are interested in teaching a class on environmental politics and protection. Will your affiliation with CWRU remain as it has, or do you plan to become a faculty member?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">BARNENS: Honestly, who knows? I&rsquo;d like to teach a class, but I&rsquo;m not sure how many students would be interested in a topography 101 type of deal. Maybe in the future, but for now, I&rsquo;ll remain in the position I currently have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">SEASONS: Thank you again for speaking with us, Dr. Barnens. We hope to talk to you soon.</span></p>
